Daily Standups Sprint 2: Oct 15, Oct 18, Oct 21 8am in Toronto time (Discord)

Team capacity should be optimal for sprint 2, but based on what we learned from Sprint 1 we definitely expect for minor issues to occur. However,
we feel like most of the techical issues we would face were already fixed in sprint 1, especially issues with setting up the project for multiple people.
We believe that we can handle the same amount of user story points from sprint 1, we will also make sure to add non-coding tasks for the project to JIRA.

Meeting goal: Finish all tasks breakdowns and assigning, choose which tasks to complete hopefully by end of sprint 2, identify spikes.

Potential spikes: Connecting backend to frontend, and backend to database for various different pages for our front end, especially the content page UI, and donation
-related pages/

Sprint goal: At the end of Sprint2, we will focus on features necessary for a donor and homeless youth, and complete user stories 2, 19, 76, 80, 86, 99, 104, 105 
which allows the homeless youth to create donation goals, donors to see them through the content page, search feature for donors to donate to specific people, and
and overall donation system using our in-app currency. We decided to pursue user stories below for this sprint2, because we believe that the donation feature for a donor and
homeless youth are the most important feature in our product. By the end of sprint 2, we expect to have a working app where users can navigate to specific pages like the 
content page and search page in our app to donate to specific individuals or donate to Being Seen directly through the About Us page.
