Meeting up for sprint 1 retrospective conducted on Oct 19 (Discord) Participants: Suguru Seo, Jiaxuan Zhang, Pengpeng Cao, Hong Sung Ye Ansel, Andreas Alexander
Hsu Shen Lee, Sarina Pui Ting Cheung

Reflections on improvements we can make for future sprints:

1.User story point estimates should reflect actual work (sometimes underestimate), also relates to point 3.

2.Documentation 
   Backend API documentation comes first in order to better prepare for frontend
   (Backend Doc explaining how API works)
   Front end API documentation 
   Front end people should know what API they need

3.For some tasks, division for subtask for frontend and backend might be needed
Separate a big task to lots of small tasks
Each subtask has a detailed and clear explanation

4.Understand what each other is doing in terms of code helps the process
Everyone understands each other’s task and what other features require and so we can help each other
Communicating each other (front end and back end corroborate each other)
When you need help, ASK ASAP!!!!  when you are lost

5.Discuss and make sure everyone understands the overall system design before starting the work

6.Working together with 1 or 2 people with similar tasks helps the process

7. Add channel for backend research API
   (Stackoverflow or any helpful link)

Notes from the Demo:
1. We need to change our button colors in the UI to differentiate it from background, making it easier to see and notice. (Also helps with accessibility users)
2. Make the text sizes consistent in every page, to make it more user-friendly.
3. Everything else is looking good, so we just need to polish our UI.
