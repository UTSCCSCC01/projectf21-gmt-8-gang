We aim to have accounts that allow donors, homeless youth, social service providers, merchants to access the app. 

The app should have a working home page and respective pages for donations, profiles, and ‘About Us’. Donations should be working with real cash 
and payments and the app should store data consistently across multiple accounts (donors, youth, merchants), especially in terms of balance. 

Homeless youth should be able to sign up for an account and create a profile to introduce themselves, specifically with the right authentication process. 
They should be able to set up donation goals that they wish to achieve. The homeless youth should be able to accept donations either indirectly through 
their account or directly via scanning their QR code, though the QR code option is lower in the priority list. They should be able to find participating 
merchants via a map of some sort. At the participating location they should be able to make transactions with their in app currency to buy goods and services 
(that are allowed by the app). (User stories: 20, 19, 13, 16, 18, 15, 17)

Donors should be able to sign up for an account and create a profile page and easily donate money to homeless youth face to face via their usernames 
(and hopefully QR code, again lower priority). Donors should be able to find homeless youth and donate to their donation goals in the app. 
(User stories: 21, 22, 2, 8, 9, 5, 6, 61)

Social service providers should be able to give out verification codes to homeless youth for activating accounts either through in app-codes or other ways. 
The point is to verify the person registering to the app, and that the person is eligible to do so. (User stories: 10, 11)

Merchants should be able to create a profile and add relevant information (in particular the name of the store and their location). Merchants should be able 
to receive the in app currency as payment for goods and services. 
(User Stories: 45, 46, 47)
